
This is an extension of the HTTP::Request suite. It allows easily processing
of forms in a user-agent by filling out fields, querying fields, selections
and buttons and pressing buttons. It uses HTML::TreeBuilder generated parse
trees of documents (especially the forms parts extracted with extract_links)
and generates it's own internal representation of forms from which it generates
the request-objects to process the form application.

This is version 0.1. It requires and relies on:

   Perl version 5.004 or later

   HTTP::Request::Common
   HTML::TreeBuilder
   LWP::UserAgent

Installation should work with perl makefile.pl; make install.

Feedback (especially of the installation - my system currently doesn't support
MakeMaker correctly, so this might not work as expected)
